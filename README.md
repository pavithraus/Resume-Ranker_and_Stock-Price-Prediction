This repository contains two independent data-driven projects built using Python, Flask,streamlit, and machine learning libraries. Both projects demonstrate applied skills in NLP, deep learning, and web deployment.

## 🔹 Project 1: AI-Powered Resume Ranker

An NLP-based web application that ranks resumes based on their relevance to a given job description.

📁 Navigate to:[`AI-Powered Resume Ranker`](./AI-Powered Resume Ranker)

Inside you'll find:
- Flask app with web UI for uploading resumes
- NLP-based scoring algorithm using TF-IDF and SpaCy
- Output ranking system for HR filtering
- Sample resumes, job description, and result files
- Project report PDF

## 🔹 Project 2: Stock Price Prediction Using LSTM

A deep learning-based tool for predicting future stock prices using Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) networks.

📁 Navigate to: [`Stock Price Predictor`](./Stock Price Predictor)

Inside you'll find:
- LSTM model implemented using Keras/TensorFlow
- Stock data preprocessing and visualization
- Forecasting output plots
- Streamlit UI for interactive forecasting
- Sample output graphs and dataset links
