# üìà LSTM-Based Stock Price Prediction

An interactive stock prediction web app powered by an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) neural network. The app uses historical stock data to forecast future closing prices and is built using Streamlit for visualization.

---

## üß† Project Overview

-  Predicts stock closing prices using an LSTM model.
-  Trained on Yahoo Finance data for selected companies (e.g., TCS.NS).
-  Provides an interactive Streamlit dashboard with options:
  - Forecast next N days
  - Forecast a specific future date
  - Forecast a custom date range
-  Visualizes actual vs predicted prices
-  Allows data upload and CSV export of results
